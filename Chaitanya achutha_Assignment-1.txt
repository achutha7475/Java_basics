Assignment 1

Q1. Length and breadth of a rectangle are 5 and 7 respectively. Write a program to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle.

package Second;

public class Third {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int l=5,b=7;
		System.out.println(" Area of given rectangle is "+(l*b)+".");
		System.out.println(" Perimeter of given rectangle is "+(2*(l+b))+".");
	}

}

Q2. Write a program to add 8 to the number 2345 and then divide it by 3. Now, the modulus of the quotient is taken with 5 and then multiply the resultant value by 5. Display the final result.

package Second;

public class Fourth {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int a=8,b=2345,c,d,e,f;
		c=a+b;
		d=c/3;
		e=d%5;
		f=e*5;
	System.out.println(" Addition of number 8 to the 2345 : "+(c)+".");
	System.out.println(" Resultant after dividing the c with number 3 is : "+(d)+".");
	System.out.println(" Modulus of d after dividing it with 5 is : "+(e)+".");
	System.out.println(" Resultant after multiplying with 5 is : "+(f)+".");

	}

}

Q3. Write a program to check if the two numbers 23 and 45 are equal.

package Second;

public class Fifth {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int a=23,b=45;
		System.out.println(" The given two numbers 23 and 45 are equal. "+(a==b));

	}

}

Q4. Write a program to calculate the perimeter of a triangle having sides of length 2,3 and 5 units.

package Second;

public class Sixth {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int a=2,b=3,c=5;
		System.out.println(" Perimeter of given triangle's sides is "+(a+b+c)+".");

	}

}

Q5. If the marks of Robert in three subjects are 78,45 and 62 respectively (each out of 100 ), write a program to calculate his total marks and percentageÂ marks.

package Second;

public class Seventh {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int a=78,b=45,c=62;
		float f,r;
		r=a+b+c;
		f=r/300*100;
		System.out.println(" Total marks gained by Robert in three subjects is "+(r)+" out of 300.");
		System.out.println(" Percentage scored by Robert is "+(f)+".");
		

	}

}
